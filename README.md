# Student-Attention-Detection
The primary goal of this attention detection system is to maximize learning outcomes
during online classes. Utilizing machine learning and computer vision to provide educators and students
with real-time insights into student engagement and attentiveness. By analyzing video 
streams, these technologies detect facial expressions, body language, and object interactions 
to gauge the level of student involvement. The goal is to accurately identify patterns of 
distraction and assess overall engagement levels, allowing educators to intervene promptly 
and tailor support to individual student needs. Ultimately, this approach aims to enhance the 
online learning experience by fostering a more focused and interactive classroom 
environment.

# Dataset used
A custom dataset was created for training, comprising 15,000 images. The dataset was built by capturing images of human subjects, including me, my team members and our friends. This approach ensured a diverse yet controlled dataset for model development. The inclusion of real-world samples enhanced the robustness and generalizability of the model, laying the foundation for future scalability with larger and more diverse datasets.
